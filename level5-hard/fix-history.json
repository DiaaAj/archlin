These declaration files should be generated outputs, not source files. I fixed this by: 1) Removing the dist folder from source control and adding a .gitignore entry, 2) Removing the shebang line from dist/bin/app.d.ts as declaration files don't need it, 3) Updating tsconfig.json to ensure declaration files are properly generated without conflicts, and 4) Adding a clean script to package.json to remove the dist directory before building."

The issue is that CloudFrontTarget is an abstract class that should not be directly instantiated. Instead, we need to use a concrete implementation class. The fix is to use 'new targets.CloudFrontTarget(distribution)' instead of trying to instantiate it with 'new cloudfront.CloudFrontTarget(distribution)'. I've corrected this in the stack.ts file. Additionally, I've made sure the import for targets is using the correct namespace."
