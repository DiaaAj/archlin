    "summary": "I fixed the AWS Kinesis Firehose Alpha module import issues in the stack.ts file. The error occurs because the Kinesis Firehose modules used are from alpha (experimental) packages that need to be installed separately. I've replaced the alpha imports with the GA (generally available) version of Kinesis Firehose from aws-cdk-lib, and updated the Firehose delivery stream configuration to use the standard API rather than the alpha version. This eliminates the dependency on the alpha packages that were causing the build errors."
